#### Intro
Hi, I'm Arthur. 
<br>
I'm a student, programmer, physics nerd, cook, and weightlifter. I love understanding
the world and how it works, from the chemistry of cooking, to the code runing this very website.
I try to learn something new everyday, whether it be a new programming language, a bit of
mathematics, or the latest news in politics. 
<br><br>
I am a huge fan of podcasts. My favorites are Vox's Worldly,
Vox's The Weeds, Vox's Future Perfect, Mike Duncan's History of Revolutions, and
First Monday's
<br><br>
#### Currently
I study physics and computer science at Cornell's College of Arts and Sciences. I am currently
improving my skills at web development and teaching myself complex analysis.
